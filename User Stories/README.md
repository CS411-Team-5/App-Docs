### Register as a first time user (through social media account):

As a first-time user, I want to be able to login to the app using social media outlets that I’m already connected to. I should be able to login using Facebook or Twitter for convenience - these options should be readily apparent when I first want to register. If I don’t have access to Facebook and Twitter, I want to be able to login through the app itself. For the sake of familiarity, I would prefer this to be a simple username and password field. I’m concerned about my privacy, so the password should not be visible in plain-text, and I would like a re-assurance that my information is not being shared or stored in an insecure fashion. After registration, I would like to begin using the app as soon as possible, beginning with entering my preferences (User Story 2).

### Enter in initial preferences/reviews:

As a first-time user, I want to be able to indicate my personal preferences towards different types of media so that the app can link me with other people and professional critics who have similar tastes. With this intent in mind, I want to be able to easily search for media and select products that I’m acquainted with. Ideally, I should be presented with both a visual and written representation of the product in question, since it might be easier for me to recall a product by its cover art. Because I want my recommendations to be as accurate as possible, I want to be able to rate as many initial products as I want, and I should be able to indicate when I’m finished.

### Logging in as returning user:

“As a returning user, I want to be able to login without having to enter in my username and password so I can access the application quicker.”
Our users that have already completed User Story 1 want to log in to the app without having to re-enter data. A Remember Me button would be enabled to allow the user a one-button login where they only have to press the login button instead of retyping their email and password.

##

### Add additional reviews to profile:

“As a logged-in user, I want to be able to add new reviews to my profile so that my recommendations and preferences become more focused.”
A returning user, having completed User Stories 1, 2, and 3 will be able to search for recently-interacted-with-media and add their new review and rating to their profile. This new review/rating will update their preferences and focus the recommendations to be more accurately tailored toward what they like. 

##

### Delete or update preferences/reviews:

A user can update or delete any reviews they have previously made to increase the accuracy of recommendations. A user must have an account (User Story 1) and must be signed in (User Story 3). On their profile page they can find a list of the movies, tv shows, or books that they reviewed at least from initial registration and the review they assigned it (User Story 2).  There will be a delete button that will allow the user to delete a review completely. There will also be an update button that will allow a user to change a rating they previously assigned. 

##

### Give me recommendations based on my reviews:

On a user’s home page or profile there will be a list of recommended media based upon critics who rated media similarly to them. It will show the media and possibly an accuracy score next to each one to show how precise the match is. Users can click on a title to rate it or can delete it from their recommended list if they no longer wish to see it there. The user could have the ability to save a title for later so they can later view a list of media they have saved.
